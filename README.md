# Infiland's Localization Tool
 A tool used to translate Infiland's games like TCC and Asteroids++, now open source!
# Purpose
 The way my games use translations is that each sentance has an 'id', based on the id the game knows different bits of text in the game.
 If let's say 'hello' was id = 1, if a german translator came in, he would put 'hallo' in his file, thus the game knows that 'hello' and 'hallo' are the same but in different languages.
 The problem is that the games have hundreds of lines of sentances, and many have to have the indexing system for them to work, so this small tool was made to make the process faster
